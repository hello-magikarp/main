🧑‍💻 Levels of Hardness
🔹 Easy / Start Mode

    Sum of Array Elements — Read n integers into an array, print their sum.

    String Length Calculator — Implement your own strlen using pointers.

    Simple File Reader — Open a text file and print its contents line by line.

🔹 Intermediate Mode

    Dynamic Memory Allocator — Allocate memory for n integers, fill with values, compute average, free memory.

    Reverse Words in a File — Read a file, reverse each word using pointers, write to another file.

    Command Line Argument Parser — Program that takes arguments and prints them with their index.

🔹 Hard Mode

    Mini Database with Structs — Store student records (name, age, grade) in a binary file, allow adding and listing.

    Pointer‑Based Matrix Multiplication — Implement multiplication of two matrices using dynamic allocation and pointer arithmetic.

    File Permission Checker — Read file metadata (permissions) and print whether user can read/write/execute.

🔹 Bonus Mode (Cybersecurity‑Themed Projects, Modules 1–5 Only)

Here are 5 proposals — you’ll pick one to tackle:

    Password Strength Checker (Strings + File I/O)

        Reads passwords from a file.

        Checks length, presence of digits/special chars.

        Flags weak vs strong.

    Caesar Cipher File Encryptor (Pointers + File I/O)

        Reads plaintext from a file.

        Encrypts using Caesar shift (e.g., +3).

        Writes ciphertext to another file.

    Log File Analyzer (File I/O + Strings)

        Reads a system log file.

        Counts failed login attempts.

        Prints summary report.

    Memory Safe String Copy (Pointers + Memory Management)

        Implement a secure strncpy clone.

        Prevent buffer overflow by checking bounds.

    Simple Access Control Simulation (C Basics + File I/O)

        Program with a list of users and permissions stored in a file.

        Reads username input, checks if allowed to perform an action.
